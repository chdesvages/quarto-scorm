# Generate SCORM package from static HTML site

This is a basic bash script to generate a bare-bones functional SCORM package to upload a static HTML site onto a VLE. This can be used e.g. with static sites rendered by Quarto or BookML.

An example is included, using [this single-page Quarto site](https://chdesvages.github.io/quarto-display-settings/).
